    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a **parallel agent** using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a ParallelAgent?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **ParallelAgent** is a workflow agent that executes multiple sub-agents **concurrently**, enabling:\n",
    "- Faster execution by running independent tasks simultaneously\n",
    "- Concurrent data retrieval from multiple sources\n",
    "- Parallel processing of independent operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tech Stack**: ADK with Gemini 3\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "## Parallel Agent Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo shows how to build a **flexible parallel agent system** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Specialization by Information Type\n",
    "Each agent specializes in a **type of information** (not a specific product):\n",
    "- **PriceAgent**: Looks up pricing for ANY product\n",
    "- **DetailsAgent**: Looks up detailed descriptions for ANY product  \n",
    "- **BasicInfoAgent**: Provides basic summaries for ANY product\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. **User asks** about one or more products (e.g., \"Tell me about smartphone and headphones\")\n",
    "2. **ParallelAgent** runs all 3 specialists concurrently, each storing results in session state\n",
    "3. **MergerAgent** reads all results from state and creates a consolidated report\n",
    "4. **SequentialAgent** orchestrates the flow: parallel execution → then consolidation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Architecture is Required\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SequentialAgent([ParallelAgent, MergerAgent])** pattern is necessary because:\n",
    "1. **ParallelAgent** executes sub-agents concurrently but stores results in session state via `output_key` - it doesn't automatically consolidate\n",
    "2. **MergerAgent** needs to read from session state using `{placeholders}`, but these variables must exist before the agent starts\n",
    "3. **SequentialAgent** guarantees execution order: ParallelAgent populates state first, then MergerAgent reads and consolidates\n",
    "4. Without SequentialAgent, the merger would try to read state variables that don't exist yet, causing a KeyError\n",
    "5. This is the official ADK pattern for parallel execution + consolidation - attempting to use a single coordinator agent fails because it can't get a second turn after delegation\n"
